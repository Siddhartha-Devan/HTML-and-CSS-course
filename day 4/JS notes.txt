JS: it is an interpreted lang (that's why it is a script lang)
	var, let and const.
		const = just like static variable in python (eg. pi, g, e).
		var   = u can change the values.
		let   = var is a global scope variable, whereas let is a local scope variable.

console.log(  ) : used to print output.
